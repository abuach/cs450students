# LLMs have flaws

- Garbage-In, Garbage-Out
- AI Hallucinations
- AI Slop 

---

# The ultimate copy machine

# But lacking in originality (and creativity?)

---

# I have to know what I'm looking for

---

# I have to know the right questions to ask

---

# I have to guide the AI 

---

# I have to review the AI 

---

# I have to know what "correct" looks like.

---

# I have to make sure everything works and makes sense.

# Instructor Responsibility

- I will do my best to focus the material on SWE tools and practices that are currently in popular use today.
- I will do my best to make the course fun and engaging. 


---

# Students' Responsibility

Positive Attitude (also see syllabus)

---

# ‚ÄúMistakes happen all the time, particularly in software development‚Äù

--- 

# ‚ÄúGerald Weinberg coined the term *egoless programming* in his book **The Psychology of Computer Programming**‚Äù (1971)

---

# THE RULES OF EGOLESS PROGRAMMING (slightly modified)

- Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
- ‚ÄúYou are not your code.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúNo matter how much ‚Äúkarate‚Äù you know, someone else will always know more.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúTreat people with respect, deference, and patience.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCritique code instead of people.‚Äù

## TBH not that great but it's a start

---

## Are you a **real** programmer?

---

![bg contain](images/realprogrammers.png)

---

# what are the most important things for modern software engineering students to know/have?

---

a strong foundation in core computer science principles

---

modern development practices like **AI-assisted workflows** and **DevOps**

---

interpersonal and strategic skills

---

A *real software engineer* is both a skilled programmer and an effective collaborator who understands the business context of their work

---

# Core technical fundamentals
- Data structures and algorithms 
- Programming languages
- Databases
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

# Modern development practices

---


## Agile methodologies
Most development teams operate using agile methods. A strong grasp of practices like **Scrum and Kanban**, including sprint planning and code reviews, is essential for working effectively in a team environment.

---

## AI literacy and AI-assisted development 
AI is now an integral part of the development process. Students need to know how to effectively use tools like **GitHub Copilot** for code generation and how to **debug, review, and productionalize AI-generated code**. Familiarity with **AI model APIs and prompt engineering** is also highly valuable.

---

## Cloud computing and DevOps 
Modern applications are built and deployed in the cloud. Students must understand how **cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP) and DevOps practices (**CI/CD, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes**) work to deliver reliable and scalable software.


---

## Version control 
Expertise with version control systems, especially **Git and platforms like GitHub**, is non-negotiable. This enables effective **collaboration, code reviews** via pull requests, and the ability to track and manage changes over time.


---

## Cybersecurity
Security must be a primary consideration, not an afterthought. Students should learn **secure coding practices, understand common vulnerabilities**, and be aware of cybersecurity risks.


---

## Testing and debugging 
Writing **automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)** is a fundamental skill. A developer's ability to **logically debug and troubleshoot** problems is a core measure of their technical depth.

---

# In the age of AI, soft skills matter more than ever!

--- 

![bg contain](images/softskills.png)

--- 

# Soft skills and strategic thinking

---

- Communication 
- Collaboration 
- Leadership 
- Critical Thinking
- Persuasion 

---

- Charisma 
- Presence 
- Personality 
- Aura

---

![bg contain](images/aura.jpeg) 

---

# Communication and collaboration
Software engineering is a **team-based discipline**. You must be able to clearly **communicate technical concepts** to both technical and non-technical colleagues, **give and receive feedback** effectively, and **write clear documentation**.

---

# Problem-solving and critical thinking
At its core, engineering is about solving problems. The ability to **logically break down complex issues**, analyze options, and **design optimal solutions** is more valuable than knowing any specific syntax.

---

# Business-driven engineering
The best engineers understand the **business context and user needs** behind the features they build. They can manage **trade-offs between technical elegance and business goals**, and they can **articulate how their work delivers real value**.

--- 

# Adaptability and continuous learning
The tech landscape **evolves** rapidly. A modern software engineer must be a lifelong learner who is open to new tools, languages, and methodologies to remain relevant and effective.

### In principle, software engineering is a simple two‚Äêstep process: 

---

(1) Write a best‚Äêselling program, and then 

(2) buy expensive toys with the profits. 


---

## Unfortunately, the first step can be rather difficult.


---

## To produce great software, you need to handle a huge number of complicated tasks

Any one of which can fail and sink the entire project

---

# Over the years people have developed a multitude of **approaches, methodologies and techniques** to help keep software project **tasks** on track

- Waterfall 
- Agile 
- Extreme Programming

---

## First we will discuss those basic **tasks** that any successful software project must handle in some way

---

## Then we will discuss how different **approaches** such as **Waterfall and Agile** handle those tasks.

**"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. The other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult."**
‚ÄîC.A.R. Hoare

Learning Objectives:
-  The basic steps required for successful software engineering
-  Ways in which software engineering differs from other kinds of
engineering
-  How fixing one bug can lead to others
-  Why it is important to detect mistakes as early as possible


---

In many ways, software engineering is a lot like other kinds of engineering.

---

## Software Engineering from Pluto 

- make a plan
- follow that plan
- heroically overcome unexpected obstacles üí™

---

## The following describes the steps you need to take to keep a software engineering project on track
